# =========================================================================

# Please read the README and FAQ for more information

# Some distros (most notably Redhat) dont have
# everything we need in $PATH so we specify it here.
# Make sure modprobe, iptables, and route are here,
# as well as ordinary items such as echo and grep.
# Default is as shown in the example below.
#PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin

# Set the path to ipkungfus runtime error log.
# Default: /var/log/ipkungfu.log
#IPKUNGFU_LOG=

# Your external interface
# This is the one that connects to the internet.
# Ipkungfu will detect this if you dont specify.
#EXT_NET="eth0"
#EXT_NET="eth1"
#EXT_NET="ppp0"

# Your internal interfaces, if any.  If you have more
# than 1 internal interface, separate them with
# spaces.  If you only have one interface, put "lo"
# here. Default is auto-detected.
#INT_NET="eth0"
#INT_NET="eth1"
#INT_NET="lo"

# IP Range of your internal network.  Use "127.0.0.1"
# for a standalone machine.  Default is a reasonable
# guess. Separate multiple ranges with spaces.
LOCAL_NET="192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0"

# Set this to 0 for a standalone machine, or 1 for
# a gateway device to share an Internet connection.
# Default is 1.
GATEWAY=0

# TCP ports you want to allow for incoming traffic
# Dont add ports here that you intend to forward.
# This should be a list of tcp ports that have
# servers listening on them on THIS machine,
# separated by spaces. You can add port ranges
# delimited by hyphens, such as "20-22". Default 
# is none.
#ALLOWED_TCP_IN="21 22"

# UDP ports to allow for incoming traffic
# See the comments above for ALLOWED_TCP_IN
#ALLOWED_UDP_IN=""

# Temporarily block future connection attempts from an
# IP that hits these ports (If module is present)
# Hits to these ports will be logged as "BADGUY" hits
# regardless of log.conf settings.
FORBIDDEN_PORTS="135 137 139"

# Drop all ping packets?
# Set to 1 for yes, 0 for no. Default is no.
BLOCK_PINGS=1

# Possible values here are "DROP", "REJECT", or "MIRROR"
#
# "DROP" means your computer will not respond at all. "Stealth mode"
#
# "REJECT" means your computer will respond with a
# message that the packet was rejected.
#
# "MIRROR", if your kernel supports it, will swap the source and
#   destination IP addresses, and send the offending packet back
#   where it came from.  USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION! Only use this if you fully
#   understand the consequences.
#
# The safest option, and the default in each case,,  is "DROP". Dont change 
# unless you fully understand this.


# What to do with 'probably malicious' packets
#SUSPECT="REJECT" 
SUSPECT="DROP"

# What to do with obviously invalid traffic
# This is also the action for FORBIDDEN_PORTS
#KNOWN_BAD="REJECT"
KNOWN_BAD="DROP"

# What to do with port scans
#PORT_SCAN="REJECT"
PORT_SCAN="DROP"

# How should ipkungfu determine your IP address? The default
# answer, "NONE", will cause ipkungfu to not use the few
# features that require it to know your external IP address.
# This option is good for dialup users who run ipkungfu on
# bootup, since dialup users rarely use the features that
# require this, and the IP address for a dialup connection
# generally isnt known at bootup.  "AUTO" will cause
# ipkungfu to automatically determine the IP address of
# $EXT_NET when it is started.  If you have a static IP
# address you can simply enter your IP address here.
# If you do port forwarding and your ISP changes your IP
# address, choose NONE here, or your port forwarding
# will break when your IP address changes. Default is
# "NONE".
#GET_IP="NONE"
#GET_IP="AUTO"
#GET_IP="128.238.244.16"

# If the target for identd (113/tcp) is DROP, it can take
# a long time to connect to some IRC servers. Set this to
# 1 to speed up these connections with a negligible cost
# to security.  Identd probes will be rejected with the
# 'reject-with-tcp-reset' option to close the connection
# gracefully. If you want to actually allow ident probes,
# and you're running an identd, and you've allowed port
# 113 in ALLOWED_TCP_IN, set this to 0. Default is 0.
#DONT_DROP_IDENTD=0

# Set this to 0 if youre running ipkungfu on a machine
# inside your LAN.  This will cause private IP addresses
# coming in on $EXT_NET to be identified as a spoof,
# which would be inaccurate on intra-LAN traffic
# This will cause private IP addresses coming in on 
# $EXT_NET to be identified as a spoof. Default is 1.
#DISALLOW_PRIVATE=1

# For reasons unknown to me, ipkungfu sometimes causes
# kernel panics when run at init time. This is my
# attempt to work around that.  Ipkungfu will wait
# the specified number of seconds before starting, to
# let userspace/kernel traffic catch up before executing.
# Default is 0.
#WAIT_SECONDS=5

# This option, if enabled, will cause ipkungfu to set
# the default policy on all builtin chains in the filter
# table to ACCEPT in the event of a failure.  This is 
# intended for remote administrators who may be locked 
# out of the firewall if ipkungfu fails.  A warning to 
# this effect will be echoed so that the situation can be
# rectified quickly.  This is the same as running
# ipkungfu with --failsafe.  Default is 0.
#FAILSAFE=0

# Configurable list of kernel modules to load at runtime.
# If no list is provided, the default and needed ones,

# Port Configurations #
#######################
#
#
# Some example port configs for classic and basic Stealth modes
#
# I like to always keep some ports at the low end of the spectrum.
# This will detect a sequential port sweep really quickly and usually
# these ports are not in use (i.e. tcpmux port 1)
#
# ** X-Windows Users **: If you are running X on your box, you need to be sure
# you are not binding PortSentry to port 6000 (or port 2000 for OpenWindows users). 
# Doing so will prevent the X-client from starting properly. 
#
# These port bindings are *ignored* for Advanced Stealth Scan Detection Mode.
#

# Un-comment these if you are really anal:

# Any port *below* this number will be monitored. Right now it watches 
# everything below 1024. 
# 
# On many Linux systems you cannot bind above port 61000. This is because
# these ports are used as part of IP masquerading. I dont recommend you
# bind over this number of ports. Realistically: I DONT RECOMMEND YOU MONITOR 
# OVER 1024 PORTS AS YOUR FALSE ALARM RATE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RISE. Youve been
# warned! Dont write me if you have have a problem because Ill only tell
# you to RTFM and dont run above the first 1024 ports.

# This field tells PortSentry what ports (besides listening daemons) to
# ignore. This is helpful for services like ident that services such 
# as FTP, SMTP, and wrappers look for but you may not run (and probably 
# *shouldnt* IMHO). 
#
# By specifying ports here PortSentry will simply not respond to
# incoming requests, in effect PortSentry treats them as if they are
# actual bound daemons. The default ports are ones reported as 
# problematic false alarms and should probably be left alone for
# all but the most isolated systems/networks.

# Options to dispose of attacker. Each is an action that will

#
##################
# Ignore Options #
##################
# These options allow you to enable automatic response
# options for UDP/TCP. This is useful if you just want
# warnings for connections, but dont want to react for  
# a particular protocol (i.e. you want to block TCP, but
# not UDP). To prevent a possible Denial of service attack
# against UDP and stealth scan detection for TCP, you may 
# want to disable blocking, but leave the warning enabled. 
# I personally would wait for this to become a problem before
# doing though as most attackers really arent doing this.
# The third option allows you to run just the external command
# in case of a scan to have a pager script or such execute
# but not drop the route. This may be useful for some admins
# who want to block TCP, but only want pager/e-mail warnings
# on UDP, etc.
#
# 
# 0 = Do not block UDP/TCP scans.
# 1 = Block UDP/TCP scans.
# 2 = Run external command only (KILL_RUN_CMD)

###################
# Dropping Routes:#
###################
# This command is used to drop the route or add the host into
# a local filter table. 
#
# The gateway (333.444.555.666) should ideally be a dead host on 
# the *local* subnet. On some hosts you can also point this at
# localhost (127.0.0.1) and get the same effect. NOTE THAT
# 333.444.555.66 WILL *NOT* WORK. YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT!!
#
# ALL KILL ROUTE OPTIONS ARE COMMENTED OUT INITIALLY. Make sure you
# uncomment the correct line for your OS. If you OS is not listed
# here and you have a route drop command that works then please
# mail it to me so I can include it. ONLY ONE KILL_ROUTE OPTION
# CAN BE USED AT A TIME SO DONT UNCOMMENT MULTIPLE LINES.
#
# NOTE: The route commands are the least optimal way of blocking
# and do not provide complete protection against UDP attacks and
# will still generate alarms for both UDP and stealth scans. I
# always recommend you use a packet filter because they are made
# for this purpose.

# TCP Wrappers#
###############
# This text will be dropped into the hosts.deny file for wrappers
# to use. There are two formats for TCP wrappers:
#
# Format One: Old Style - The default when extended host processing
# options are not enabled.
#
#KILL_HOSTS_DENY="ALL: $TARGET$"

# Format Two: New Style - The format used when extended option
# processing is enabled. You can drop in extended processing
# options, but be sure you escape all '%' symbols with a backslash
# to prevent problems writing out (i.e. \%c \%h )
#
KILL_HOSTS_DENY="ALL: $TARGET$ : DENY"

###################
# External Command#
###################
# This is a command that is run when a host connects, it can be whatever
# you want it to be (pager, etc.). This command is executed before the 
# route is dropped or after depending on the KILL_RUN_CMD_FIRST option below
#
#
# I NEVER RECOMMEND YOU PUT IN RETALIATORY ACTIONS AGAINST THE HOST SCANNING 
# YOU!
#
# TCP/IP is an *unauthenticated protocol* and people can make scans appear out 
# of thin air. The only time it is reasonably safe (and I *never* think it is 
# reasonable) to run reverse probe scripts is when using the "classic" -tcp mode. 
# This mode requires a full connect and is very hard to spoof.
#
# The KILL_RUN_CMD_FIRST value should be set to "1" to force the command 
# to run *before* the blocking occurs and should be set to "0" to make the 
# command run *after* the blocking has occurred. 
#
#KILL_RUN_CMD_FIRST = "0"
#
#
#KILL_RUN_CMD="/some/path/here/script $TARGET$ $PORT$ $MODE$"

# Scan trigger value#
#####################
# Enter in the number of port connects you will allow before an 
# alarm is given. The default is 0 which will react immediately.
# A value of 1 or 2 will reduce false alarms. Anything higher is 
# probably not necessary. This value must always be specified, but
# generally can be left at 0. 
#
# NOTE: If you are using the advanced detection option you need to
# be careful that you dont make a hair trigger situation. Because
# Advanced mode will react for *any* host connecting to a non-used 
# port below your specified range, you have the opportunity to
# really break things. (i.e someone innocently tries to connect to
# you via SSL [TCP port 443] and you immediately block them). Some
# of you may even want this though. Just be careful.
